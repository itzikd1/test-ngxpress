## 🐞 Reporting Issues
- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/angularcafe/ngxpress/issues) before opening a new one.
- Provide a clear, descriptive title and as much relevant information as possible (steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, screenshots, etc.).

## 🚀 Feature Requests
- Check if your idea already exists in [issues](https://github.com/angularcafe/ngxpress/issues).
- Clearly describe the feature, its use case, and any alternatives you’ve considered.

## 🛠️ Pull Requests
1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Describe your changes** in the pull request (PR) template.
3. **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR is best.
4. **Write clear, concise commit messages.**
5. **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes when possible.
6. **Follow the coding style** (see below).
7. **Ensure your code builds and passes linting/tests** before submitting.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Standards
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code formatting and linting.
- Use TypeScript for all code (frontend and backend).
- Organize code by feature (feature-first structure).
- Use import aliases instead of long relative paths.
- Write clear, descriptive comments where necessary.

## 📦 Project Structure
- **Frontend:** `src/app/` (Angular)
- **Backend/API:** `src/api/` (Express)
- **Database:** `prisma/` (Prisma schema)

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `fix(auth): handle token expiration`, `feat(todos): add bulk delete endpoint`).
- Reference issues by number when relevant (e.g., `fix: resolve #42`).

## 🤝 Code of Conduct
Please be respectful and inclusive. See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if available.
